                About JIIRA Jewellery
            </h2>
            <p class="lead fade-in">Conceived in an art studio five years ago, Jiira Jewellery is the birthchild of fine art student
                Jiratchaya Chaiyasak. Being a lover of anything that combines art with beauty, Jiratchaya discovered the perfect 
                manifestation of this when she started designing jewellery. Having been taught how to fashion jewellery from silver 
                by one of the most renowned art teachers in northern Thailand, Jiratchaya was able to give life to her own designs.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="lead fade-in"> Every piece is lovingly created by hand with materials ehtically sourced exclusively from 
                Thailand. Being handmade means that you can be sure that your purchase, while it may look like other products, 
                is always intrinsically unique. Jiira Jewellery provides stunning pieces that combine timeless looks with a 
                touch of Siamese beauty.
