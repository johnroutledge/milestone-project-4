**Rationale**

Jiira is a fully functional e-commerce website specialising in handmade jewellery from Thailand. Jiira's current online sales channels are through Facebook Marketplace and Lazada, a Thai version of Amazon/eBay. To extend Jiira's market outside of Thailand and to better showcase the product range, a tailor-made website is required.

This website is designed to promote Jiira's products and provide news on the company, while at the same time fulfulling the full stack framework milestone project four requirements of the Code Institue course.

It has e-commerce functionality for customers using Stripe for payments, has an admin area for the business owner to maintain the product range and blog posts which provide updates on Jiira's activity. Visitors to the website also have the ability to leave comments on the blog posts, giving them more interaction with the Jiira brand.


The typical user for the website would be someone who:
* Is 
* Is 
* Is 
* Knows 
* Wants 

People visiting this website are looking for:
* 
* A 
* The 
* An 

Jiira is the ideal site for such people because:
* It includes all of the above in one place
* It has intuitive controls and layout
* It is both clear and concise in its layout
* The information it provides is kept to a minimum to avoid cognitive overload

## UX

**Strategy**

User needs:  visually appealing, simple to navigate, easy to register, straightforward to search/select/add items to basket/checkout, intuitive design, unintimidating and stylish appearance.

ADD MORE HERE


**Scope**

User Stories:

ADD STORIES TABLE HERE


**Structure**

To make sure the content/functionality is intuitive to navigate, I maintained consistency throughout the different pages by using the same layout/structure (landing page sections matched the order of menu items) and header and footer elements.

On the landing and blog pages, I used content hinting so that users would be encouraged to scroll further down the page.

**Skeleton**

To make sure the app is intuitive to navigate and use, I decided to ADD CONTENT HERE. By minimizing the amount of visual content past the landing page, I also reduced distraction and maximized engagement.

**Surface**

The 'Monserrat' Google font was chosen to give a clean and modern feel, while the white/grey/pink color scheme added to this style.

The color scheme was chosen as it feels clean and stylish, yet also soft in order to match the style of Jiira's product range. At the same time, it is both visually unintimidating and easy on the eye. ADD MORE HERE!!!!!! The button color is consistent throughout the app to maintain consistency and increase the intuitiveness of the page.

The model hiding her face hero image was chosen for the landing page as it suggests the page is about jewellery, while at the same time evoking a slight feeling of intrigue and mystery often synonymous with Thailand. The large message within the hero image was used to give a clear, unambiguous description of what the website is about.

The Jiira logo used in the nav bar was used to maintain consistency.
