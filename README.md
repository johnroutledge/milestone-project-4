**Full Stack Frameworks with Django Milestone Project**

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/johnroutledge/milestone-project-4)

**Rationale**

Jiira is a fully functional e-commerce website specialising in handmade jewellery from Thailand. Jiira's current online sales channels are through Facebook Marketplace and Lazada, a Thai version of Amazon/eBay. To extend Jiira's market outside of Thailand and to better showcase the product range, a tailor-made website is required.

This website is designed to promote Jiira's products and provide news on the company, while at the same time fulfulling the full stack framework milestone project four requirements of the Code Institue course.

It has e-commerce functionality for customers using Stripe for payments, has an admin area for the business owner to maintain the product range and blog posts which provide updates on Jiira's activity. Visitors to the website also have the ability to leave comments on the blog posts, giving them more interaction with the Jiira brand.


The typical user for the website would be someone who:
* Is interested in jewellery
* Is just browsing for jewellery ideas
* Is looking to buy jewellery
* Knows about Jiira
* Wants to find unique, handmade Thai Jewellery

People visiting this website are looking for:
* Fashionable Jewellery
* A range of earrings/necklaces/rings
* The latest in handmade jewellery
* Special discounts

Jiira is the ideal site for such people because:
* It includes all of the above in one place
* It has intuitive controls and layout
* It is both clear and concise in its layout
* The information it provides is kept to a minimum to avoid cognitive overload

## UX

**Strategy**

The business goal is to design and build a fully-functioning e-commerce site so that people can browse, choose and purchase Jiira's products. It also needs to encourage users to register so that they have access to their own profile and order history. This also gives the business owner the potential to market directly to registered users (subject to marketing opt-ins).

To satisfy user needs, the site must be visually appealing, unintimidating, simple to navigate and have intuitive design with stylish appearance. It should also be straightforward to search/select/add/edit/remove items to the basket as well as having a simple yet secure checkout.

From the business owner's point of view, the site must provide the ability to easily maintain the product offering. It should also enable the business owner to create brand loyalty through registration and sharing relevant news items about the company.

**Structure**

To make sure the content/functionality is intuitive to navigate, I maintained consistency throughout the different pages by using the same layout/structure wherever possible and having standard header and footer elements. There is also a logical workflow throughout the site which signposts how users get specific information and where they can go to next.

On pages that take up more than the visible vertical area, I used content hinting so that users would be encouraged to scroll further down the page.

**Skeleton**

To make sure the app is intuitive to navigate and use, all UI elements are placed in such a way as to optimize the user journey through the website. For example, buttons and links are in similar locations on each page. Furthermore, by minimizing the amount of text content past the landing page, I also reduced distraction and maximized user engagement.

**Surface**

The 'Monserrat' Google font was chosen to give a clean and modern feel, while the white/grey/pink color scheme added to this style.

The color scheme was chosen as it feels clean and stylish, yet also soft in order to match the style of Jiira's product range. At the same time, it is both visually unintimidating and easy on the eye. The button color is consistent throughout the app to maintain consistency and increase the intuitiveness of the page.

The model hiding her face hero image was chosen for the landing page as it suggests the page is about jewellery, while at the same time evoking a slight feeling of intrigue and mystery often synonymous with Thailand. The large message within the hero image was used to give a clear, unambiguous description of what the website is about.

On larger screen sizes, a purpose-made video replaces the hero image. This video was made especially for Jiira jewellery and showcase some of the products. It is only viewable on larger screen sizes as they don't generally use mobile data and so usage it's not an issue. The video is not active on mobile or tablet as I didn't want to eat into people's data allowance which may cause them to have an unfavourable reaction to the website.

The Jiira logo used in the nav bar and favicon was to maintain consistency and reinforce the brand.
