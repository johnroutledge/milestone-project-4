## Responsiveness Testing
The website was tested on various screen sizes using Chrome DevTools, from iPhone5 up to 5k screen.

It was also tested using [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) and the results were as per the following image:

![Main Mockup](/readme/images/jiira_mockup.png "Main Mockup")

## Testing Browser Compatibility

The website was successfully opened and rendered correctly in Chrome (both desktop and mobile versions), Edge and Safari.


## HTML Testing
HTML was validated using the W3C Markup Validation Service. This was done using the 'Validate by Direct Input' option.

The main errors which had to be fixed were all within the basket app and related to duplicate IDs on the quantity-form.html, one of which is shown
in the following image:

![HTML Test Errors](/readme/images/code/html_test_errors.png "HTML Test Errors")

These occured because
basket.html references the quantity-form twice, and hides one depending on the device size (mobile or desktop). To fix the errors, the IDs in question were changed to classes and the javascript was also changed to look for the class rather than ID.

Having remedied the above errors, all HTML checks resulted in warnings as per the image below. These were non-critical issues and therefore not fixed following advice from my tutor.

![HTML Test Warnings](/readme/images/code/html_test_warnings.png "HTML Test Warnings")


## CSS Testing
CSS was validated using the W3C Markup Validation Service. This was done using the 'Validate by Direct Input' option.

Results of all tests came back with the same 'no errors found' message, as per the image below:

![CSS Test Results](/readme/images/code/css_test_results.png "CSS Test Results")


## JavaScript Testing

JavaScript was tested with [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) JavaScript linter. Warnings were thrown up (as per the images below), but no errors or anything which required a code change.  Some examples of the JavaScript test results are as follows:

#### base.js<br>
![Base.js Test Results](/readme/images/code/base_js.png "Base.js Test Results")

#### observers.js<br>
![Observers.js Test Results](/readme/images/code/observers_js.png "Observers.js Test Results")

#### basket.html javascript<br>

#### banner text javascript<br>
![Changing Banner Text JavaScript Test Results](/readme/images/code/changing_banner_text_js.png "Changning Banner Text JavaScript Test Results")


## Python Testing
Python code from all .py files was checked using [Pep8online](https://www.pep8online.com).

The first check on each file brought back numerous errors which were all rectified (see note below), so subsequent tests all passed. A small selection of results are shown in the screenshot below:

![Python Test Results](/readme/images/code/python_test_results.png "Python Test Results")

Note: There was one 'line too long' error (see bottom-right screenshot in above image) in settings.py which wasn't fixed after consulting with my mentor. I also checked on Slack and several other students' MS4 projects (which had passed grading), all of which left the same error alone.


## Lighthouse Testing
The results shown in the images below are for the home, products, basket, checkout, news item and contact pages on both mobile and desktop. These were chosen as they produced the lowest figures and best illustrate the gains made by implementing Lighthouse's recommended changes.

All improvements were made to the accessibilty scores as these were the lowest on all tests. To improve the scores, an 'alt' value was given to the Jiira logo and 'aria-label' values were given to the search icon in the navbar (both mobile and desktop) and quantity controls in the basket page.

## Notable Bug Fixes

1. User Profile Drop-Down Menu

In an early version of the website, when clicking on the user profile icon in the navbar, the resulting drop-down menu appeared partially off screen (see screenshots below). This occured on both mobile and desktop versions. To fix the issue, the class 'dropdown-menu-right' was added to the offending div in both 'base.html' and 'mobile-top-header-html'. 

![User Profile Menu Bug](/readme/images/code/user-profile-menu-bug.png "User Profile Menu Bug")


2. Review Form Bug

Towards the end of the development of the website, I decided to add the 'reviews' app in order to give users the ability to add product reviews. Once the initial code was in place, the review form wasn't appearing on the product details page. Having read and re-read my code for over an hour, I finally realised that it was a simple naming mistake in the view which was causing the problem. While a was passing a 'form' in, I had called it 'review_form' instead of 'form'. Once I changed the name to just 'form', the reivew form then rendered correctly on the page product details page. Below are screenshots of the code before and after the changes.
